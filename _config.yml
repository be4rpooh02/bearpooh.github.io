about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a <mark>data engineer</mark> with experience in developing ETL batch pipelines based on <mark>Spark, Hadoop, and AirFlow</mark>. I started my career in 2010 by <mark>responding to malware incidents</mark> and have 8 years of experience. I also worked as an <mark>evangelist</mark> for incident prevention. I contributed to the development of an ETL pipeline for antivirus products that collected data from **25 million** active endpoints, which supported AI model training and product application. Additionally, I led the development of an automation project for discovering neglected data and ETL pipelines for the incident response team's big data platform.
  Currently, I am responsible for the service development, operation, and maintenance of an ETL pipeline platform that collects and transforms data required for analysis and utilization in gaming services. I also believe that big data technology should be accessible to everyone, so I share methods for building and integrating these technologies on my personal blog.
  Through defining and solving problems on my own, I have experienced **immersion and growth**. I pursue work efficiency improvements through automation of repetitive tasks and process optimization. Having started later in my career, I am determined to experience various data and technologies more intensely and aim to grow into a technical leader in the field of data engineering.
